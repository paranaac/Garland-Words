# Garland-Words

A garland word programming challenge.

A garland word is one that starts and ends with the same N letters in the same order, for some N greater than 0, but less than the length of the word. I'll call the maximum N for which this works the garland word's degree. For instance, "onion" is a garland word of degree 2, because its first 2 letters "on" are the same as its last 2 letters. The name "garland word" comes from the fact that you can make chains of the word in this manner:

onionionionionionionionionionion...
